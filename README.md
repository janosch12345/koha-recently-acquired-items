# koha-recently-acquired-items

This is a little project which displays the recently aquired items on a koha opac. 
It is based on php.

Requires either access to google-apis or amazon-api for getting the urls of coverimages.
It is up to you to extend the Coverresoler (under libs) for other/open services.
